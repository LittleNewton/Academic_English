《几何原本》是最早的一本内容丰富的数学书，而且为所有后世科学家所使用。这本书对数学发展的影响超过任何别的书。读了这本书之后，可以对数学本身的看法、对证明的想法、对定理按逻辑次序的排法，都学到一些东西，而且它的内容也决定了其后的思想发展。因此我们应该指出它有哪些特点能如此深刻地影响日后的数学以及其他自然科学。开头就摆出所有的公理，明确提出所有的定义以及一系列定理——这是欧几里得所独创的。证明方法的机械化使得人们不用再担心结论不可靠。这种体系下的结论必然是可靠的——只要假设可靠。这直接导致了反证法的出现。这种基于逻辑思维的证明方法在后世的几乎所有的自然科学推导种都占据了统治地位，比如经济学就把人都是理智的作为了公理来进行经济博弈分析，而物理学完全是猜想与推导的一种结合，在实验探索中的对照试验也无非是一种二元论思想的实践。

Euclid's Elements is the earliest rich math book and is used by all scientists of later generations. This book has more influence on the development of mathematics than any other book. After reading this book, you can learn something about mathematics itself, ideas about proofs, and logical ordering of theorems, and its content determines the subsequent development of ideas. Therefore, we should point out what features it has that can profoundly influence future mathematics and other natural sciences. At the beginning, all axioms were put forward, and all the definitions and a series of theorems were clearly put forward. This was originally created by Euclidean. The mechanization of the method of proof makes it unnecessary for people to worry about the conclusion being unreliable. The conclusion under this system must be reliable - as long as the assumptions are reliable. This directly led to the emergence of counter-evidence. This method of proof based on logical thinking occupies a dominant position in almost all natural science derivational species in later generations. For example, economics puts people as rational axioms for economic game analysis, and physics is entirely speculative. A combination of derivation and comparison experiments in experimental exploration are nothing more than the practice of a dualistic idea.
